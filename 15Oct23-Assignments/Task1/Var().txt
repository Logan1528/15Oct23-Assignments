1. Explain the purpose of using the var()?

 CSS variables can have a global or local scope. Global varibales can be used through the 
entire document. while local variables can be used only inside the selector where it is 
declared. to create a variable with globe scope, declare it inside the :root selector. the
:root selector matches the document's root element. to create a variable with local scope
declare it inside the selector that is going to use it.

Advantages of using var() are:

* makes the code easier to read (more understandable)
* makes it much easier to change the color values
